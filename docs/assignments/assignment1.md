## Interview Report - College Student :school:
#### Interviewee Profile :information_source:
- **Background:** 20-year-old international sophomore at MIT, studying in the U.S. away from a strict family environment.
- **Social Media Habits:** Uses WhatsApp for daily emotional support from family and friends, Snapchat for boosting self-confidence with filters, TikTok for light entertainment, and Instagram with two accounts—public and private—to manage different aspects of her digital identity.


#### Report :black_nib:
The interview with the international sophomore from MIT revealed a complex dynamic between her positive academic experiences and the emotional challenges amplified by social media. She expressed gratitude for the support from professors and opportunities at MIT, yet underlying this success was a sense of inadequacy fueled by impostor syndrome. "It feels like everyone is doing so much more," she shared, reflecting on how the competitive atmosphere and social interactions, both in-person and online, contribute to this feeling. From this starting point, we explored her varied use of social media platforms—WhatsApp, TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram—and how each uniquely affects her sense of self and well-being. Starting with WhatsApp, she described it as a crucial lifeline for emotional support through daily conversations with family and friends. However, she also expressed discomfort with being in group chats that include people she doesn’t want to interact with, saying, "I wish I could contribute... but certain people in that group could not see whatever I sent." This frustration reveals her desire for more selective engagement in digital spaces, where she can communicate freely without the fear of judgment or bias, highlighting a broader need for more nuanced privacy controls that current platforms lack.

Additionally, she shared how her struggles with self-image play out on Snapchat, where she often uses filters to "boost her self-confidence" and see herself in a more positive light. At the same time, Snapchat also brings feelings of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) when she sees friends’ stories of social activities like clubbing or partying—things she feels disconnected from due to her strict upbringing. "Even though I'm in college now, my upbringing still affects me," she reflected, highlighting her inner conflict between wanting independence and feeling restricted by her past. Her experience on TikTok similarly combines moments of joy with frustration; while she enjoys the funny content, she finds it stressful when her feed suddenly fills with sad videos: "I hate how easily my feed changes when I interact with sad videos." This need for a more stable and predictable digital environment also shows in her use of Instagram, where she manages two separate accounts—a "main" for public, curated content and a "spam" for more personal and private posts—demonstrating her need for safer spaces to express herself. Outside the digital realm, she turns to activities like journaling and religious groups for more genuine and lasting positivity, suggesting that social media platforms could be designed to better support mental well-being by offering more control, personalization, and emotional safety.

## Interview Report - Full-Time Worker :office:

#### Interviewee Profile :information_source:
- **Background:** Late 20s development engineer with a background in chemical engineering and business management, currently living in Massachusetts and preparing for marriage.
- **Social Media Habits:** Primarily uses Instagram and WhatsApp to stay connected with family and friends plus being updated with the latest world news.

#### Report :black_nib:
The interview with the full-time development engineer offered a nuanced look into how her evolving responsibilities and life changes have shaped her relationship with social media. Reflecting on her time during the COVID-19 quarantine, she described this period with a sense of nostalgia, recounting how being quarantined with friends made the experience more bearable despite the isolation. As an international student who graduated during the pandemic, she valued the constant interaction with her peers. However, there was also a downside; she felt anxious about the travel restrictions that prevented her from returning home to visit family. To stay connected during this time, she relied heavily on WhatsApp for communication. Meanwhile, to stay informed about global events, she followed several news sites on Instagram. Over time, however, the relentless barrage of negative news became overwhelming. "It was scary," she recalled about watching the death counts rise, leading her to unfollow these accounts to protect her mental health. This marked a turning point in how she approached social media, moving from using it as a tool for connection and information to needing a break from its emotional toll. Once highly engaged, she now finds herself more mindful and selective in her usage, noting that her Instagram feed tends to reflect whatever phase of life she is in—currently focused on marriage and family planning.

As we explored more of her current social media habits, she explained how her relationship with these platforms has continued to evolve. She described how her usage sometimes spirals into "doom scrolling," despite her efforts to set boundaries. Social media often makes her "hyper-fixated" on negative content, which affects her mental state, prompting her to set specific times for usage to manage these effects better. For instance, she avoids using social media after 10 p.m. or when she is with her partner, limiting it to specific times like after evening workouts. Still, she finds it challenging to maintain these boundaries and expressed a desire for an "accountability partner" who could help control her access to apps like Instagram, imagining a setup where she would need a code or password from someone else to unlock the app after a certain time. In her quest for positivity, she actively shares Bible verses, words of encouragement, and uplifting quotes on her social media, finding joy in being a "people's person" who offers support to friends and family through group chats and social interactions. However, she also expressed a sense of loss as she grows older, noting that she no longer goes out as much due to increased responsibilities and feeling easily drained. This shift has led her to dream of a social media app focused solely on positivity—free from the toxicity that often permeates online spaces—a digital refuge where she could turn for comfort and encouragement. Her reflections suggest a broader desire for social media platforms that provide emotional safety, balance, and meaningful connection in a way that aligns with her evolving needs.

## Design Opprotunities :construction:

- **Enhanced Privacy Controls in Group Chats:**
The college student expressed discomfort with sharing messages in group chats that include people she doesn’t want to interact with. This suggests a need for more granular privacy controls that allow users to selectively hide messages from specific group members, fostering safer and more open communication.

- **Personalized Content Filtering for Emotional Well-being:**
Both interviewees were impacted by negative content algorithms—one overwhelmed by pandemic news on Instagram, the other frustrated by TikTok’s quick shift to sad content. A solution could be a user-defined content filtering system that lets users set emotional or content-based preferences, maintaining a desired emotional state in their feed.

- **Accountability-Based Social Media Usage Management:**
The full-time worker mentioned wanting an "accountability partner" to help limit her social media use. This suggests a feature where users can designate trusted contacts to manage their app access with time locks or password systems, promoting healthier digital habits through social accountability.

- **Positivity-Centric Social Media Platform:**
The full-time worker envisioned an app focused solely on positivity, away from internet toxicity. A new platform could be designed to prioritize uplifting content, filtered to exclude negativity, with features like gratitude journals, supportive community groups, and content moderation focused on well-being.

- **Real-Time Emotional Check-In Features:**
The emotional toll from social media content noted by both interviewees suggests an opportunity for real-time emotional check-ins. Platforms could periodically ask users about their feelings and adjust content or provide mental health resources based on their responses.

- **Community-Driven Content Moderation:**
Both interviewees appreciated support from positive group interactions. A feature that allows communities to collaboratively moderate content and maintain supportive digital spaces could empower users to create environments aligned with their values.
