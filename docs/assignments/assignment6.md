## Usability Test 01 :speech_balloon:

<div style="margin-left:20px">


### Tester profile :bust_in_silhouette:
The first tester was a woman in her early 20's who is a college graduate and is currently working fulltime in the finance industry. She uses social media mildly because of current work schedule.

### Summary Report :chart_with_upwards_trend:
The test began with introductions and a brief explanation of the app's purpose. The tester then worked through tasks as I read the instructions aloud. An interesting observation was the initial confusion during the "View a User Profile" task. When the tester was on the profile page, she was unsure where to proceed, but she resolved this by returning to the main feed and clicking on the poster's name. This suggests a potential usability issue related to navigating profiles from the profile view itself.

Another key moment occurred during the "Create an Uplifting Story" task, where the feed options failed to display in the dropdown. This issue was specific to Safari, as switching to Chrome resolved it. This indicates a compatibility problem that may need addressing to ensure consistent functionality across different browsers.

Overall, the tester found most features easy to navigate, and she appreciated the design. During the debriefing, she highlighted the user-friendly interface, mentioning the color scheme as a positive feature that aligned with the app's focus on positivity.

However, she also made several suggestions: adding pictures and videos to posts, incorporating profile photos, and using markers (e.g., background colors) to differentiate posts by feed. These features could enhance personalization and make the content more engaging. The tester also pointed out that some form fields, such as "Notify About," could use more descriptive hints, and she found the lack of a commenting option somewhat odd.

### Flaws and Opportunities for Improvement :hammer:

- **Browser Compatibility Issue (Conceptual, Major):** The dropdown not appearing in Safari could create significant user barriers. Ensuring compatibility across major browsers would improve the app's accessibility.

- **Unclear Form Field Labels (Linguistic, Moderate):** Some fields, such as "Notify About," lacked clarity. Adding more descriptive placeholder text or tooltips could reduce confusion.

- **Lack of Visual Differentiation for Feeds (Conceptual, Minor):** Posts from different feeds could be visually distinguished with background colors or tags. This would help users quickly identify the content type.

- **No Commenting Option (Conceptual, Minor):** Although the app aims to limit negativity, the absence of commenting felt unusual to the tester. Providing an explanation or adding a limited form of interaction (e.g., reactions) could balance positivity with engagement.

## Usability Test 02 :speech_balloon:

<div style="margin-left:20px">


### Tester profile :bust_in_silhouette:
The second tester was a woman in her early 20s, currently a senior pursuing a bachelor's in engineering. Her social media usage habits are relatively low, citing it as being too distracting at times.

### Summary Report :chart_with_upwards_trend:
The test began similarly to the first, with a quick briefing on the app's purpose, followed by task instructions. The tester generally moved through the tasks well, but there were a few points of confusion. When asked to check her friend requests, she initially navigated to her profile page and looked in her friend list instead of the friend request list. She soon recovered by navigating to the appropriate notifications page. This indicates potential confusion between the "friend list" and "friend request" terminology.

Another notable observation occurred during the "Send a Friend Request" task. The tester expressed frustration navigating to an individual's profile, finding it tricky. Although she later managed to do it, this friction highlights a need to streamline navigation to profiles.

During the "View a User Profile" task, the tester noticed that a friend’s profile still displayed a button to add them as a friend, even though they were already friends. This inconsistency caused confusion and could impact the user's overall experience.

In the debriefing, the tester highlighted several usability challenges. First, during the "Create an Account or Log In" task, she was confused about where to register, as the navbar only showed a "Login" option. She relied on intuitive knowledge from other apps to infer that "Login" might include registration. The shared login/register page also felt cluttered, and she suggested separating these into distinct pages or combining them into a single form.

For the "Create an Uplifting Story" task, the tester found the add post button's position somewhat misleading at first, thinking it was a helper tool. She suggested that a tooltip might improve clarity. Additionally, after creating a post, she was returned to the home feed, but the feed navbar did not update accordingly, which added to her confusion. She felt the feed navbar should reflect the correct feed after any action.

The tester also mentioned that adding a journal was easy but suggested design consistency between the journal and add post buttons. She expected to be redirected to her journal list after creating a new entry, and she also found the truncated journal entry list confusing without an accompanying "Read more" button.

In terms of reacting to posts, she found the interaction unclear initially, only realizing it was possible to react based on the reaction count. Making the buttons more interactive could improve this experience. Lastly, she found accessing her friends cumbersome and felt the app lacked an emphasis on the friend concept, suggesting adding a "Friends" option to the main navbar. The reporting feature was intuitive, but she expected a more visible confirmation, such as a color change on the flag icon, to signify success.


### Flaws and Opportunities for Improvement :hammer:
- **Login and Registration Confusion (Conceptual, Moderate):** The shared login/register page and limited navbar options led to confusion. Separating these forms or adding distinct registration prompts could enhance usability.

- **Friend Request vs. Friend List Confusion (Linguistic, Moderate):** The tester initially struggled to differentiate between the friend list and friend request features. Using clearer and more distinct terminology could help mitigate this confusion.

- **Profile Navigation Difficulty (Physical, Moderate)**: Navigating to an individual's profile was cumbersome. Streamlining the navigation path or adding more direct links could reduce frustration and improve the user experience.

- **Friend Button Inconsistency (Physical, Minor):** The add friend button remained visible even when viewing a friend's profile. Updating the button to reflect the current relationship status would reduce confusion.

- **Unclear Reaction Buttons (Physical, Minor):** The reaction buttons were not initially perceived as interactive. Adding visual feedback, such as animations or color changes, could make their functionality more apparent to users.
