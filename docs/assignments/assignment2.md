# Assignment 2: Divergent Design :mag:


## Background :information_source:
<b>App Name:</b> UpLift :up:
<br>

<b>Intended Audience: </b> People from all walks of life who are looking for a place to fill up their positivity in their lives and pour positivity in other people’s lives. I believe life is more fulfilling when we pour into each other’s cups
<br>

<b>Intended Value:</b>  most apps have little to no regulation when it comes to spreading negativity or toxicity, and most people are easily susceptible to be stuck in echo chambers of negativity/toxicity that affects them one way or another, UpLift is aimed to act as a siphon to draw the negativity that people get from other social media apps and replace that with positivity.

## Feature Brainstorming :bulb:
- **Gratitude Journal:** A personal space for users to write daily reflections, positive thoughts, and things they are grateful for. Entries can be shared publicly or kept private.
- **Daily Uplift:** A daily notification or feed of curated positive content, such as inspirational quotes, stories, or videos, to start the day with positivity.
- **Kindness Chain:** Users can start and join chains of kindness, where they perform a good deed and encourage others to continue the chain by doing their own good deeds and sharing them.
- **Support Circles:** Small, themed groups where users can join and share experiences, provide support, and offer advice on specific topics such as mental health, wellness, parenting, etc.
- **MoodBoost:** A quick-access feature that provides users with short, uplifting content like affirmations, guided breathing exercises, or calming sounds based on their current mood.
- **Compliment Carousel:** A feature where users can send anonymous or public compliments to others. Compliments are displayed on a rotating "carousel" on the recipient's profile.
- **Good News Only Feed:** A customizable feed that aggregates only positive news stories from around the world, filtering out negativity and focusing on uplifting content.
- **Positivity Challenges:** Weekly or monthly challenges that encourage users to engage in positive behaviors, such as expressing gratitude, helping others, or practicing self-care. Completion earns badges or rewards.
- **Reflect and Share:** A feature that prompts users to reflect on positive moments at the end of each day or week and share them with their network or keep them private.
- **Virtual Hug:** A simple, emotive feature that lets users send a "virtual hug" to someone who may need support or comfort. Virtual hugs could be animated or paired with kind messages.
- **Uplift Stories:** A storytelling section where users can share short stories of personal growth, overcoming challenges, or acts of kindness, encouraging a culture of positivity and resilience.
- **Heartfelt Reactions:** Instead of standard "likes," users can react with different positive emotions like "Inspired," "Grateful," "Joyful," and "Encouraged" to content they appreciate.
- **Positive Reminders:** Users can set up personalized reminders that encourage them to take breaks, practice mindfulness, or check in with friends.
- **Mentorship Match:** A feature that connects users who want to offer guidance or need advice on personal growth, mental health, or career development, fostering supportive mentor-mentee relationships.
- **Mindful Moments:** Guided short activities like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or reflective journaling that help users stay grounded and cultivate mindfulness throughout the day.
- **Acts of Kindness Map:** A live map feature showing small acts of kindness happening around the world. Users can add their own contributions, creating a visual representation of positivity.
- **Gratitude Swap:** A fun feature that pairs users to exchange messages of gratitude with one another, encouraging positive interactions and connections.
- **Affirmation Builder:** A tool that allows users to create, customize, and share their own positive affirmations or motivational quotes with others.
- **Supportive Boosts:** Users can "boost" posts that uplift or inspire them, increasing the visibility of positive content within the app.
- **Safe Space:** A dedicated area where users can share their challenges or worries without judgment and receive constructive support or encouragement from the community


## VSD Analysis :clipboard:
1. **Stakeholders - Direct and Indirect Stakeholders**

    **Observation:** Direct stakeholders are the users engaging with positivity features like Gratitude Journals and Support Circles. Indirect stakeholders could be family members or friends who benefit from users' improved mental health and positivity.

    **Design Response:** Incorporate features that allow users to share positive experiences or achievements with non-users via other messaging platforms, bridging the gap between direct and indirect stakeholders and expanding the app's positive impact. 

2. **Time - Long-Term Health and Well-Being**

    **Observation:** Over time, daily interactions with features like MoodBoost and Mindful Moments could promote sustained mental well-being. However, overuse could potentially lead to reliance on the app for emotional regulation.

    **Design Response:** Introduce usage analytics and reminders that encourage users to balance their time on the app with offline activities that promote well-being, helping to prevent over-reliance and promoting healthier habits.

3. **Pervasiveness - Widespread Use and Cultural Adaptation**

    **Observation:** If UpLift becomes widely adopted globally, cultural misunderstandings could arise around features like Compliment Carousel, which may not align with all cultures' norms of expression.

    **Design Response:** Develop culturally adaptive versions of features where users can select or customize interaction styles and tone to better fit their cultural context, enhancing inclusivity and reducing the risk of misunderstandings.

4. **Values - Value Tensions (Community vs. Privacy)**

    **Observation:** There is a potential value tension between fostering community (through Support Circles) and maintaining user privacy. Some users may be hesitant to share personal experiences in a community setting.

    **Design Response:** Implement privacy controls that allow users to participate in Support Circles anonymously or under pseudonyms, ensuring users can engage in community activities while maintaining their privacy.

5. **Time - Medium-Term Effects on Social Dynamics**

    **Observation:** Over a medium-term period, users could become competitive about "positivity scores" (e.g., through features like Positivity Challenges), potentially leading to inauthentic behavior to gain status.

    **Design Response:** Replace any "scoring" or "leaderboard" elements with non-competitive acknowledgments like personal growth milestones or badges that focus on self-improvement rather than comparison.

6. **Values - Inclusivity and Accessibility**

    **Observation:** Features like Virtual Hug or Heartfelt Reactions may not be accessible to users with certain disabilities (e.g., visual or motor impairments).

    **Design Response:** Ensure all interactive elements are compatible with screen readers and offer alternative text-based interactions for users with disabilities, enhancing accessibility and inclusivity.

7. **Stakeholders - Moderation and Community Management**

    **Observation:** As the community grows, content moderation may become challenging, especially for features like Support Circles or Uplift Stories, potentially leading to negative experiences.

    **Design Response:** Incorporate AI-assisted moderation tools combined with community guidelines and human oversight to maintain a safe and supportive environment.
