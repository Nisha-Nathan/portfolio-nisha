I absolutely loved the PlantIt project idea presented by Bouncing Beavers in our last class lecture. The concept of a project organization and motivation tool that rewards users with digital plants is not only creative but also incredibly cute! I think it adds a refreshing and fun twist to task management, making it more engaging for users who enjoy visual progress and growth. The thought of nurturing a virtual garden as a reward for productivity is just delightful.

The target audience for PlantIt ranges from students to full-time workers, which is great in terms of broadening its impact. However, I can't help but feel that digital plants might be more appealing as a reward to students compared to full-time workers. There could be a slight disconnect in how these groups perceive value. When considering motivation across all audiences, money tends to be a strong overall motivator(At least among people around me incuding myself üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏èüôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏è ). This made me think of an app I've been using called <a href= "https://sweatco.in/">Sweatcoin</a>, which converts the number of steps you take into virtual currency. This currency can then be used to buy things in their marketplace, ranging from $5 gift cards to larger items or even donations.

I think applying a similar concept to PlantIt could be really powerful. By integrating a form of virtual currency or tangible rewards alongside the digital plants, the tool could better appeal to a wider audience and motivate everyone to see their projects through to completion. This way, PlantIt could combine the cuteness of the digital plants with a more universally motivating factor, making it an even more effective and inclusive productivity tool
