# Microsoft Bob :construction_worker:: A Great Idea, but Where Did It Go Wrong? 

When exploring products that had genuinely good intentions but ultimately missed the mark, Microsoft Bob stood out as a prominent example for me. Bob, launched in 1995, aimed to make personal computing more accessible to those intimidated by traditional user interfaces. The idea was simple: create a friendly, home-like environment to help beginners navigate their computers in a way that felt familiar and less technical.

On paper, this sounded like a fantastic approach, but in practice, Microsoft Bob was a usability disaster. After watching a video of Microsoft Bob's interface and diving deeper into its design, I could see why it failed: users simply didn't know how to use it. This inspired me to apply the principles of a cognitive walkthrough to understand where Microsoft Bob went wrong.

## Cognitive Walkthrough
To understand the user struggles, let’s break down two essential tasks users would need to perform with Microsoft Bob. By analyzing these tasks with a cognitive walkthrough, we can highlight the challenges that users faced. The cognitive walkthrough focuses on key questions to determine whether users could understand what to do, how to do it, and whether they knew they were successful.

### Task 1: Write a word document


#### Actions
<br>
<div style="margin-left:10px">

<h6>1. Navigate to "Office" room</h6>
<br>
<div style="margin-left:40px">
<b>Question 1: </b>  Does the user know they need to use the door or Rover to navigate to the "Office"?

> <u>Potential Issue:</u> Users might not understand that these are navigation tools, as the interface lacked any explicit signifiers or instructions. The concept of using a virtual "door" wasn't intuitive to many users, especially those new to computing.

<b>Question 2: </b>  Can the user easily find and recognize how to use the door or Rover for navigation?

> <u>Potential Issue:</u> While Rover was interactive, there were no obvious markers that the doors were also interactive. Users might have opted to turn off any tips, which further reduced the clarity of how to use these features. Additionally, the doors were placed on the sides, out of the main line of sight, making them even less discoverable. Without explicit guidance, users might click around the screen randomly or become frustrated when nothing happened.

<b>Question 3: </b>  Once used, does the system provide feedback that they are in the correct location?

> <u>Potential Issue:</u> The only feedback given was a change in scenery to another room. For a novice user, this change was not enough to confirm they were in the right place to find the word processor. Additionally, the concept of an "Office" might not have made sense to all users due to differences in cultural contexts—not everyone is accustomed to the idea of a standard office layout.

<b>Question 4: </b> Does entering this new room help them progress toward their goal of finding a word processor?

> <u>Potential Issue:</u> Users may not see immediate options for word processing, and there was no confirmation that they had found the correct application. Even if the word processor was opened, it lacked onboarding or any form of instruction to help users create a new document. Moreover, in the video, we saw that opening the word processor required choosing from a series of confusing options before being able to start writing, which was overwhelming for the user.

<br>
<h6>2. Select the word processor application from within the room.</h6>
<br>
<div style="margin-left:40px">
<b>Question 1: </b>  Is it clear that a word processor is available in this room?

> <u>Potential Issue:</u> Icons or labels used within the room were ambiguous. Users might not clearly understand that a particular icon represented a word processing application, especially without familiar visual cues.

<b>Question 2: </b>  Can users easily associate an icon with word processing tasks?

> <u>Potential Issue:</u> If the word processor icon looked like an abstract object or piece of office furniture, users might not immediately connect it with writing or editing text. In reference to the video I watched, the word processor looked like papers with a pencil on top, this might still be ambiguous to some users, personally I might thought maybe it was an icon linked to a form of communication like email writing.

<b>Question 3: </b> After selection, does it start correctly, indicating success?

> In this context, this is when atleast the user has some clarity on whether they are close to attaining their goal, because a word processor would load up and show on the screen

<b>Question 4: </b> Does opening the application show progress towards document creation?

> <u>Potential Issue:</u>  Even if the word processor opened, users were often unsure how to proceed due to a lack of direction and overwhelming choices that needed to be made before even starting to write.

### Task 2: Check Email
#### Actions
<br>
<div style="margin-left:10px">

<h6>1. Navigate to "Living room"</h6>
<br>
<div style="margin-left:40px">
<b>Question 1: </b> Do users know they need to go to the "Living Room" for email access?

> <u>Potential Issue:</u> The metaphor of the "Living Room" for checking email was highly abstract. Users might not easily connect the idea of a living room with managing their communications, as it wasn’t a natural or intuitive metaphor.In addition to this, the issue of different cultural contexts is seen, because whilst some other cultures might connect the idea of a living room with managing communicaions, others won't.

<b>Question 2: </b>  Can they easily find and recognize how to navigate there?

> <u>Potential Issue:</u> The method of navigation—using a door or a virtual dog—was not intuitive. If users didn't already understand the metaphor, they would struggle to find the correct room.

<b>Question 3: </b>   Does entering this room provide feedback that email can be accessed here?

> <u>Potential Issue:</u> Same issue observed in previous task, simply changing the background scenery wasn’t enough to indicate to users that they were in the right place to check email, leading to uncertainty.

<b>Question 4: </b> Does this action bring them closer to checking their email?

> <u>Potential Issue:</u>  Even after reaching the Living Room, users might not see an immediately recognizable icon or tool for accessing email, thus failing to perceive any real progress.

</div>

<br>
<h6>2. Select the email application</h6>
<br>
<div style="margin-left:40px">
<b>Question 1: </b>  Is it clear which application is used for email?

> In this context, mail was represented by envelopes in a box on the table, which made it clear that this was related to email. The use of envelopes for representing mail was intuitive for most users, given the common association of envelopes with written correspondence at the time.

<b>Question 2: </b>  Can users easily identify and select this application for checking emails?

> As answered in the previous question, since mail was represented by envelopes then users could easily identifiy this application and select it to check emails

<b>Question 3: </b> After selection, does it open correctly, showing emails?

> <u>Potential Issue:</u>  When the application opened, the layout changed again, displaying only two boxes—one labeled "New Mail" and another labeled "Outgoing." It wasn't immediately clear to users whether they needed to click on one of the labels, or if the emails would appear elsewhere. This ambiguity could lead to confusion about the next step to access their email

<b>Question 4: </b>  Does accessing emails demonstrate progress towards managing communications?

> <u>Potential Issue:</u>  The process was ambiguous. If users didn't click the correct label, they might assume they had no new emails or that something went wrong. The lack of onboarding or step-by-step guidance further contributed to confusion, making it challenging for users to confidently understand the current state of their email or make progress in managing it.

## Final Thoughts

Microsoft Bob was an ambitious attempt to make computing more accessible to beginners, but it ultimately failed to deliver on its promise. Unlike Bob the Builder, who confidently says, "Can we fix it? Yes, we can!", Microsoft Bob wasn't able to fix the user experience issues it faced. The unclear metaphors, lack of feedback mechanisms, and reliance on unintuitive navigation tools—like Rover the dog—confused users and led to a frustrating experience. Bob could have been more successful by using standard iconography, providing better feedback, and making navigation clearer and more intuitive. Ensuring that users knew where they were and what to do next without ambiguity could have made Microsoft Bob a product that was more effective, usable, and ultimately loved by its audience.
