I found <a href="https://ashi-kamra.github.io/portfolio-akamra/blogs/blog1.html">Ashi's blog post</a> incredibly thought-provoking, especially the question of whether we should introduce new technologies to solve the problems created by previous innovations—essentially, whether we should fight fire with fire. You mentioned AI as a case where the harm may outweigh the benefits, and I think this is an important discussion to have.

I would start by stating that I believe that as humans, we are naturally geared toward change. We are always innovating, always looking for the next big thing. It's a fundamental part of who we are—always evolving, always thinking about what comes next. Yes, the next big thing may not always be inherently good, but that doesn't mean innovation will stop. Instead of questioning whether we should innovate, I think our focus should be on reflecting on the factors that influence these innovations, such as current societal structures.

Whatever technology we create is ultimately a reflection of the society we live in. Even though technology is often made with the assumption that it can "correct for human error, pushing systems toward a standard of computational objectivity," as quoted from  this <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/disrupting_the_gospel_of_tech_solutionism_to_build_tech_justice">article</a> shared by Lyle in Ashi's response thread, these are just assumptions, and I do agree with the article that they are not necessarily true. Technology is a reflection of its creators and the society that shapes them. Therefore, if we want responsible innovation, we need to start by addressing the underlying societal structures. After all, technology will always be as imperfect as the people who create it.

To create meaningful change, we need to rethink our foundations. As the article shared by Lyle suggests, "To rebuild from the roots up, social change leaders, investors, and tech visionaries of all stripes must look beyond analysis generated by the very culture that helped create the problem." This, of course, is easier said than done. Change is difficult, especially when those in powerful positions have benefited from the existing systems. How could they genuinely support changes that would undo the very structures that got them into those positions?

Ultimately, to build a positive future, we can't just fight fire with fire. While the drive for change is always present, we must learn how to harness it without letting it consume us. As the article concludes, we need to resist assuming that technological problems can be solved purely through more technology. Instead, we should invest in people, ideas, and frameworks that can transform sociotechnical systems.

So while I agree with your point that we need to be cautious about which innovations we pursue, I also think it's important to recognize that change is inevitable. The challenge isn't whether or not to change—it's how we manage that change, how we ensure that it serves society positively, and how we shape the forces that influence our innovations.
