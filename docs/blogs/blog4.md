<a href="https://msequeir.github.io/portfolio-msequeir/blogs/blog4.html">Matthew's blog post</a> on building a company that genuinely cares really resonated with me, especially the question of whether big corporations can prioritize all of their stakeholders effectively. The challenges faced by companies like Google, X (Twitter), Snapchat, and Reddit in considering the broader impact of their platforms is a crucial discussion that deserves more attention.

While user behavior certainly plays a role in the problems we see on social media, I believe it is equally, if not more, important to hold companies accountable for their actions and decisions. The negative consequences we associate with social media are not only the result of user behavior but are often driven by the companies themselves. Take, for example, the practice of selling user dataâ€”a corporate decision that directly breaches user privacy. Such actions reflect a lack of genuine care for users and prioritize profits over ethical considerations. Companies like Meta (formerly Facebook) have demonstrated this time and again. For instance, Meta has faced numerous legal challenges, including a $725 million settlement for data privacy violations, as discussed in this <a href="https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/courtside/facebooks-725m-settlement-for-data-privacy-violations-may-set-a-new-standard-for-accountability/">article</a>. This settlement highlights how Meta prioritized profits over user privacy and underscores the need for greater accountability in the tech industry.

It seems that many companies do the bare minimum required to maintain user trust and keep their platforms afloat. As long as engagement is increasing, even if driven by bad actors, it is often tolerated. This approach not only reflects poorly on corporate values but also contributes to the overall harm experienced by users. As you mentioned, it becomes apparent that companies often begin addressing these issues only after they become too large to ignore, rather than taking preventive measures from the start.

Another point worth noting is that some companies, like Google (as how Justin pointed out in his <a href="https://dismint.github.io/portfolio-jchoi/blogs/response1.html">response</a> ), likely understood how transformative their products could be. The argument that companies could not predict the societal impacts of their innovations doesn't always hold up. They had the capability to consider long-term consequences but instead chose rapid growth. The same applies to communication-based platforms. They have undeniably made communication easier, but this also means that issues like scams, misinformation, and malicious behavior benefit from this ease. These platforms amplify existing societal problems, and companies need to do more to mitigate these effects.

Instead of focusing solely on growth, tech companies need to deeply consider all their stakeholders and the long-term impact of their products. Building a company that cares requires going beyond surface-level fixes and truly understanding the needs of users, employees, and society as a whole. It also requires embedding values of care, responsibility, and foresight into the company's mission from the start, rather than treating them as afterthoughts.

While I understand that achieving this balance between profit and social responsibility is challenging, it is not impossible. As Lyel mentioned, finding that sweet spot is important, but I think people need to be intentional about searching for that balance. Companies need to proactively consider how to align growth with their original values, rather than treating it as an afterthought.
