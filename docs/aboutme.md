**Name:cherry_blossom::** Nisha Nkya

**Major:pencil::** Computer Science and Engineering (6-3)

**Hometown:house::** Dar es Salaam, Tanzania

**What I love doing:heart::**  I’m into exploring fashion design and actually designing clothes—I even showcased some of my work at an MIT gala. Music is a big part of my downtime; my favorite genres are Afrobeats and Amapiano, but lately, I’ve gotten into K-pop and have been bopping to ATEEZ. I also enjoy working out—it’s something new I’ve been trying out—and I’m hoping to get into pottery soon. When I’m not designing, working out, or vibing to music, you’ll probably find me scrolling through memes or just hanging out with friends.

**What I'm interested in:mag_right::** I’m interested in a mix of creative and impactful work. In fashion design, I love creating pieces that tell a story, and I’m also drawn to web design, focusing on how to make sites user-friendly, visually engaging, and accessible to everyone. I’m passionate about making education more accessible, especially for students who may lack resources, and I’m curious about how tech can support mental health, from reducing barriers to offering new ways of managing well-being. I’m always looking for ways that technology and design can make a positive difference.

**Why I took Software Studio:crystal_ball::** Well as you can see, I love things related to design.
